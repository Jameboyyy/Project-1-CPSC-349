What We Learned:

Using Handlebar files was new to all of us. At first, it was difficult figuring out how it worked, but after reading documentation it made much more sense. It actually made it a lot easier to develop the pages because of the templates we could create. This also applied to us having to use Remake. For some of us, this was our first group project in a computer science class, but we enjoyed getting some experience with this type of assignment and more with HTML and CSS.

Files:

landing page = index.hbs, 
account creation page = signup.hbs, 
login page = login.hbs, 
main page = app-index.hbs, 
about us page = about-us.hbs, 
wireframes = wireframes folder, 
github repo link = github-repo-url.txt
